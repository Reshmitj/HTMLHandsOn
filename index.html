    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <p>Italy is well-known for its architecture, culture, art, opera, literature, film, and fashion. This is one of the
        best countries to go on a foreign tour. The country is known for its mesmerizing topography, pristine beaches,
        historical artifacts, monuments, and more. Its capital, <strong>Rome</strong>, is home to the Vatican as well as
        landmark art and ancient ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance masterpieces such as
        Michelangelo’s "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; <strong>Venice</strong>, the city of canals; and
        <strong>Milan</strong>, Italy’s fashion capital.
